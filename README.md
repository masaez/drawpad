# drawpad

When having calls in Discord or other apps, I often need to draw something quick to express an idea. Some communication tools have 'boards' for this, but they are often slow, or hard to find. 

I want to access a website, and start drawing right away, without having to create an account. Inspired by notepad, I created such a simple tool to write something. 

I also used this project as a way to practice the right way to prompt instructions to ChatGPT, so 100% of this code was written by AI.
